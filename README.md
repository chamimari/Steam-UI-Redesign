# Steam-UI-Redesign
A Human Computer Interaction individual assignment where students are told to analyse the interaction between human and certain applications.

By referencing Juxtopposed's own video on redesigning Steam's UI: https://youtu.be/cDY2p1CTkPo?si=T9DvAdWiE2zTEybg
I used her video as a guide and reference to do my own studies and analysis on why Steam's UI has so many issues such as lack of user intuitiveness and lack of natural button placements. I recreated what would be my personal intepretation of a proper UI for a platform such as Steam, borrowing some of Juxtopposed's own elements from her Figma page. I was able to create and even make an animated prototype in Figma for it.

Here is the link to the Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/5Fx5EMFWcUl5I19NQvYWcm/Steam-Improved-UI--Newest-Version-?t=6qJMvK1huVA2gKC0-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2001-924

Please keep in mind this assignment is a bit oudated as it was created around May 2025 - August 2025, so some critiques revolving around Steam's UI is possibly not consistent and accurate now.
